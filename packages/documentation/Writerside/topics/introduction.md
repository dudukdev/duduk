# Introduction

Duduk is a JavaScript Meta-Framework. It is not just a JavaScript Frontend Library, but also a complete webserver. It includes everything from components, over localization, to routing and server-side rendering.

The big difference to other similar frameworks is that Duduk does not have any magic syntax. The HTML you write inside the components is very regular HTML code without any framework specific extension. For this reason, Duduk does not need a compiler like Vite or Webpack. The build-step of Duduk does nothing then bundling your code together, and transpiling it to JavaScript if you use TypeScript.

JavaScript and CSS are very powerful these days. Many features of common frameworks are not necessary anymore. It is true that sometimes it is a bit cumbersome to use native JavaScript, but there is a very big community out there that can help you with any problem that you might have with native JavaScript. Besides this, Duduk contains some helper functions for features that are common to other frameworks, but would be very hard to use with just native JavaScript.
